# MLHHackathon
This project has won the first place in MLH Local Hack Day @Temple University..

Pink Hat
Innovated, built and demonstrated at the MLH Local Hack Day at Temple University, Pink Hat Financial offers penny stock investors the opportunity to have daily analysis of trendy, and hot penny stocks. As we all know, investing into the stock market can be a nerve wrecking experience, which will require thousands of dollars for investors to have a significant return on investment. With penny stocks, beginners can invest little and get returns that no blue chip stock can provide back. Starting at as little as $0.01 and to $5.00, penny stocks are great for a high volume trade with maximum potential for quick growth.The Pink Hat Android application provides users with penny stock analysis. With a team of financial analysts, Pink Hat will provide top-picks of penny stocks for investors with no experience, and even investors by trade. Before the market opens, the Pink Hat Android Application will have lists of chosen penny stocks as a guide for investors for that specific day. Our analysis from our financial analysts will provide a foundation for investors to get started with penny stocks.
